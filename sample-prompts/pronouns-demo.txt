// Randomly pick one of these three alternatives and set a gender flag.
{#female|#male|#neuter}

// The gender flag and the guards here will ensure that only one alternative is available, we'll use that to pick appropriately gendered pronouns:
@pronoun_3rd_object  = {?female her |?male him |?neuter it  }
@pronoun_3rd_subject = {?female she |?male he  |?neuter it  }
@pronoun_pos_adj     = {?female her |?male his |?neuter its }
@pronoun_pos         = {?female hers|?male his |?neuter its }

@^pronoun_3rd_subject {shook|swung} @pronoun_pos_adj long {blonde|red|black} hair.

// possible output:
// It shook its long black hair.
// He swung his long black hair.
// She shook her long red hair.
