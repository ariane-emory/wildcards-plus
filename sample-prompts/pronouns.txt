// Randomly pick one of these three alternatives and set a gender flag.
{#female|#male|#neuter}

// The gender flag and the guards here will ensure that only one alternative is available, we'll use that to pick appropriately gendered pronouns:
@pronoun_3rd_object  := {?female her |?male him |?neuter it  }
@pronoun_3rd_subject := {?female she |?male he  |?neuter it  }
@pronoun_pos_adj     := {?female her |?male his |?neuter its }
@pronoun_pos         := {?female hers|?male his |?neuter its }

@^pronoun_3rd_subject shook @pronoun_pos_adj head.

// possible output:
He shook his head.
She shook her head.
It shook its head.
